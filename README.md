**Medical Insurance Costs Analysis**
This project's main objective is to analyze a dataset on US health insurance costs to identify the factors that most influence the price of premiums. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, the goal is to understand the relationship between variables such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and the cost of insurance.

**Libraries Used**
The analysis was performed using the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including loading the CSV file, grouping data, and obtaining descriptive statistics.
- Matplotlib: Employed to create custom graphs, such as histograms and scatter plots, which helped visualize distributions and relationships between variables.

**Key Conclusions**
The data analysis revealed several important conclusions:

Age is a determining factor: There is a positive correlation between age and insurance costs. As a person gets older, their premium costs tend to be higher.

Smoking status is the most influential factor: Being a smoker has a very significant impact on insurance costs, being a factor that can raise premiums by thousands of dollars, much more than any other variable.

BMI (Body Mass Index) influences the cost: Patients with a high BMI tend to have higher insurance premiums.

Gender is not a primary factor: The differences in average insurance costs between men and women are minimal, suggesting that sex does not significantly influence premiums
